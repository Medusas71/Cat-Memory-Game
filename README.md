# Description  

I am currently studying the Full Stack Development Course through Code Institute.
Part of the course I am required to complete 4 milestone projects.
This memory game is my second milestone project which is part of the 
Interactive Frontend Development Module.

The cat memory game has been created for people of all ages that love cats and 
would like to test their memory.
The purpose of this website is to improve brain functionality such as focus, 
concentration and attention and to also have fun.

### 1. Strategy

The purpose of this project is to create a fun memory game for people of any age 
where they are looking for two cat cards that have the same image.
I have decided to use cats as images as they are one of my favourite animals.

### 2. Scope

The features of this project will include:

* The ability to find two matching cat images
* The ability to improve concentration skills
* The ability to improve focus skills
* The ability to improve attention to detail
* The ability to read clear instructions on how to play the game
* The ability to increase the level of difficulty to improve brain functionality
* The ability to exit the game at any time

* The ability for all the cards to be shuffled when replaying the same level
* The ability to see a cat when flipping a card
* Removal of cards that have matched

<a id="structure"></a>
### 3. Structure

The website consists of three pages:

* The Home Page that consists of the name of the game, a "Play" button and 
an "Instruction" button.
  * The "Instruction" button displays a modal with the instructions that can be 
closed by clicking the "x" button.
  * The "Play" button takes the user to Level 1 of the game.
* The 2nd page is the Level 1 game which consists of 12 cards, an "Exit" button
and a "Restart Game" button.
  * The user can either start playing the game by clicking a card; or
  * The user can click the "Exit" button and is taken to the Home Page; or
  * The user can click the "Restart Game" button where the cards will be shuffled and 
the user can start the game again.
* On completion of Level 1 a "Congratulations" displays and 3 buttons which consist
of "Play Level 2", "Replay Level 1" and "Exit to Main Menu".
  * If "Play Level 2" is clicked the user is taken to the 2nd level which is the 3rd 
  page of the website.
  * If "Replay Level 1" is clicked, the cards are shuffled and the user is able to replay
  Level 1.
  * If "Exit to Main Menu" is clicked, the user is taken back to the main menu. 
* The 3rd page is the Level 2 game which consists of 16 cards, an "Exit" button and a 
"Restart Game" button. The user can do the exact same functions as on the Level 1 game.
* On completion of Level 2, a "Congratulations" displays and 3 buttons which consist of 
"Replay Level 2", "Go back to Level 1" and "Exit to Main Menu".
  * If "Replay Level 2" is clicked, the cards are shuffled and the user is able to replay
  Level 2.
  * If "Go back to Level 1" is clicked, the user is taken back to Level 1 where 12 cards display.
  * If "Exit to Main Menu" is clicked, the user is taken back to the main menu.
