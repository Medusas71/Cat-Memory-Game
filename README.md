# Description  

I am currently studying the Full Stack Development Course through Code Institute.
Part of the course I am required to complete 4 milestone projects.
This memory game is my second milestone project which is part of the 
Interactive Frontend Development Module.

The cat memory game has been created for people of all ages that love cats and 
would like to test their memory.
The purpose of this website is to improve brain functionality such as focus, 
concentration and attention and to also have fun.
